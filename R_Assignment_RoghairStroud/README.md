# README for R assignment 
EEOB 546, S2021
Marissa Roghair Stroud

### Files
The two starting files for this assignment are `fang_et_al_genotypes.txt` and `snp_positions.txt`. The R code can all be found in the markdown file `R_Assignment_Marissa.Rmd`. 


**Note**: I have not yet generated the CSV files for the first half of the assignment. The code is there to generate them in R, but not to export them yet.
